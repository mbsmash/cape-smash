# Info

Our next Smash season will have a themed competition inspired by Fire Emblem: Three Houses.

Every player that competes in a tournament in SEMO this season will be pseudo-randomly assigned one of these three houses - however, we're going to try and make an effort to distribute our higher-level players as evenly as possible amongst the three houses.

Throughout the season, players will earn points for their team by making upsets, winning events, and winning specifically highlighted "grudge matches" with close rivals from other teams.

My Co-TOs will be performing all the calculations and will use specific formulas (which are in progress) to do so.

What I would like to do is develop two new things for my application: first, a public view that will allow community members to easily check the status of the competition throughout the season. Second, an admin console to allow my Co-TOs to input their formulas and do any sort of data validation or modification they need to.
