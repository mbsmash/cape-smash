## Overview
The Season 6 house name poll now uses Firebase Realtime Database for server-side vote tracking. This ensures that all votes are synchronized across all users in real-time.

## Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Server-Side Vote Storage
- All votes are now stored in Firebase Realtime Database
- Votes are synchronized in real-time across all users

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Vote Updates
- Vote counts update immediately when someone votes
- All users see the same vote totals
- Live updates without page refresh

### ‚úÖ Offline Support
- Falls back to localStorage if Firebase is unavailable
- Automatically syncs local votes to Firebase when connection is restored
- Graceful error handling for network issues

### ‚úÖ Duplicate Vote Prevention
- Each user session can only vote once
- Votes are tracked by unique session IDs
- Server-side validation prevents vote manipulation

```

## Technical Details

### Firebase Integration
- Uses Firebase Realtime Database for live data sync
- Atomic vote counting to prevent race conditions
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Session Management
- Each user gets a unique session ID stored in localStorage
- Session ID format: `session_{randomString}_{timestamp}`
- Prevents users from voting multiple times

### Data Validation

- Server-side vote counting with proper increment logic
- Graceful handling of network connectivity issues

## Error Handling
- Network errors fall back to localStorage
- Invalid votes are rejected
- Clear user feedback via snackbar messages
- Console logging for debugging

## Future Enhancements
- Admin panel for poll management
